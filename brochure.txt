CodeChef Ideathon MenuTeX:

Problem: - -Giving a bulk order when in a cafe or restaurant may be a big hassle to do. -Coordinating with the staff regarding the orders of any individual -Payment Problems as one has to bear the upfront cost mostly which is not always convenient

Solution: - -Making an online ordering app for the restaurant -This app will be special as it will not be like just normal food ordering -Here we will place QR Codes on each table for the ordering and it will be unique for each table, this will remove the confusion for the restaurant -Now each person at that table will order their respective food as per their wish -This won't affect the old school ordering as one can order like the old way also, it's just an option to remove the hassle -Now this will also benefit the users from a financial point of view : -Now instead of someone paying upfront the cost can be divided in two ways desired by the user:

Total Bill division in which the bill amount will be divided for the number of people and they will get their respective payment links on their mobile.
The bill will be divided according to specific order like x ordered dessert so x will only pay for it in his amount generation.
SOME CONS: -It will take time for the old-school restaurants to get trained for this new way. -People who just want to order simply using a hardcopy menu would not want to change their way of ordering(Here one person can directly order for the group on the mobile app without the need of writing down the orders
